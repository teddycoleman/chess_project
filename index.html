<!-- 
Add code to: 
1) create a data object to handle the board. First change that object and then use that to manipulate the DOM

object = {
	whiteRook: square_h1;
	whiteKnight: square_g1;
	etc
} DONE!

2) Add class for white/black to pieces DONE!

3) Add a "begin" screen

4) Have 3 problems in the backend

5) Create object to hold moves on the board.  Have a back button to let you go back through those moves  

6) change data struct to have piece be an object -> all piece <p> tags should have an id
the object for a piece should reference that id.  the method for moving a piece
should exist within the object for that piece. the "constructing piece" function should 
also exist within it.  basically, the code should be object oriented 

7) Switch to jquery???
